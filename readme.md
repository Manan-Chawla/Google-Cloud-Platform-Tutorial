Before moving forward let's learn these
1. __Networking__ :- 
- GCP provides a suite of networking services like VPC, Load Balancing, Firewalls, DNS, etc.
- We can use these services to create a secure and scalable network for our applications.
- VPC is a virtual network that we can create in GCP.
- We can use VPC to create a private network for our applications.
- We can use VPC to create a public network for our applications.
- We can use VPC to create a hybrid network for our applications.
- Generally, we can use VPC to create a private network for our applications.
- We can use VPC to create a public network for our applications.
- We can use VPC to create a hybrid network for our applications.   

2. __Compute__ :- 
- GCP provides a suite of compute services like Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, etc.
- We can use these services to create and manage virtual machines, containers, and serverless applications.

## __Ways of running instance__ :-
1. web-console
2. CLI 
3. Client Libraries
4. Rest APIs

There are 35 regions, 6 zones in each region.
There are total 210 zones in GCP.
Network edge location in gcp is a point of presence (PoP) that is used to connect GCP to the internet and there are total 180 network edge locations in GCP.
It works in more than 200 plus country and territories.

## **Difference between SAAS, PAAS and IAAS**
1. **IAAS**
- In this we need to manage
  Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS 
- It manage
  Virtulization, Servers, Storage, Networking, Security
- It's defined as a service where we can use the resources of GCP like servers, storage, networking, security etc.
- For ex -- We can use GCP to host our websites, applications, databases, storage etc.

2. **PAAS**
- In this we need to manage
  Application, Data,
- It manage
  OS, Servers, Storage, Networking, Security, Runtime, Middleware
- It's defined as a service where we can use the resources of GCP like servers, storage, networking, security, runtime, middleware etc.
- For ex -- We can use GCP to host our websites, applications, databases, storage etc.

3. **SAAS**
- It manage
  OS, Servers, Storage, Networking, Security, Runtime, Middleware, Application
- It's defined as a service where we can use the resources of GCP like servers, storage, networking, security, runtime, middleware, application etc.
- For ex -- We can use GCP to host our websites, applications, databases, storage etc.
